# Cycloidal Drive

The Cycloidal Drive V2, like other cycloidal drives, is a mechanism that translates rotational motion into precise linear motion. It consists of several key components:
Input Shaft: This is where the rotational motion is introduced into the system. An external motor or other power source is typically connected to the input shaft.
Cam Mechanism: A cam mechanism is a fundamental part of the cycloidal drive. It typically includes a disc with an off-center hole and a set of rollers or pins that engage with the cam.
Output Linkage: The output linkage is responsible for translating the motion from the cam mechanism into linear or rotary output motion, depending on the specific design of the cycloidal drive.
Enclosure: The entire mechanism is usually enclosed in a housing to protect it and ensure smooth and precise motion.
