# Completely-3D-printed-Gearboxes-for-Robotics
CAD files for the completely 3D printed gearboxes


2. **Assembly Instructions:**
Comprehensive assembly instructions are meticulously detailed in the `documentation` folder. These instructions guide you through the process of creating functional and efficient servos, gearboxes, and actuators.

3. **Customization:**
Tailor the 3D printed components to your specific project requirements. Our designs are highly modifiable to adapt to your unique needs and innovations.

## Usage

The versatility of these 3D printed components is only limited by your imagination. Here are some examples of their applications:

- **Servos:** Ideal for precision motion control, these servos find utility in robotic arms, drones, and other mechatronic systems.

- **Gearboxes:** Enhance the mechanical performance of your projects, from hobbyist robots to industrial automation.

- **Actuators:** Employ these actuators for precise and controlled linear motion, perfect for projects demanding accuracy.

For comprehensive usage guidelines and advanced applications, please consult the [Documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md) section.
