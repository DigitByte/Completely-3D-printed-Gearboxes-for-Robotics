# Magnetic Wobbling Gearbox
It's 11:1 single stage reduction gearbox. It has zero backlash, it's statically balanced and has
zero friction. It consists of a single inner magnetic ring with 11 pole pairs and sliding at 15 degrees.
There are two outer magnetic rings with tall pole pairs each. All magnetic rings have a flux backing. 
For every input shaft rotation, the inner ring oscillates once and advances by one pole pair or one
11th of a turn. The D wobbling is achieved by a constant by a CV velocity joint with 6 intervals.
After 11 turns of the input shaft, the output shaft turns once. It's backdrivable but it does 
require some force to do so.
If the output shaft is locked, the magnets behave like a clutch, skipping whole pairs.
The backlash is also springy until it skips.
