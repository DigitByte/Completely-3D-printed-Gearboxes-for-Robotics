# Magnetic Cycloidal Gearbox
With 30 arrow magnets and 20 smaller ones. It achieves a reduction ratio of 15:1. It's
only a single disk with an undersized counterbalance, so vibration at high speed is an issue. 
As with all magnetic gearboxes, it has an inbuilt overload protection even though the spacing 
air gap is half a millimeter and the torque radius is 37 millimeters, the torque transfer is
quite low.
