# Harmonic Drive (Strain Wave Gearing):

A harmonic drive, also known as strain wave gearing, is a type of high-precision, high-ratio mechanical gear system that is known for its compact size and high torque output. It consists of three primary components:

Wave Generator: This is the input element of the harmonic drive. It has an elliptical or circular shape with a wavy or corrugated structure on its surface. The wave generator is responsible for generating the wave-like motion within the system.

Flexspline: The flexspline is a thin, flexible metal or composite component with an external set of teeth. It wraps around the wave generator and is designed to flex and deform as the wave generator rotates, which drives the motion transfer to the output.

Circular Spline: The circular spline is the rigid outer ring with internal gear teeth that mesh with the teeth of the flexspline. This component is stationary and provides the housing for the entire assembly.

The harmonic drive functions by flexing and deforming the flexspline as the wave generator rotates, causing the teeth on the flexspline to engage and disengage with the teeth on the circular spline, resulting in precise and high-ratio motion transfer.
